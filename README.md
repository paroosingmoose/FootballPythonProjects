FOOTBALL 
This is an excited project where we tackle some of the big questions around Football. Working with Python to answer the big questions that keep us up at night. 
My goal for this repository is to build tools for decision making for Fantasy football and NFL game picks throughout the season. 
We will work with building statistics to determine more accurate decisions for teams and individual players.
